> **Usage Tip**: When using these prompts in Google Stitch, generate each section separately and combine them in your design tool (Figma). Adjust text and colors to match your exact brand requirements. Regenerate any section that looks too "AI-generated" with additional modifiers like "hand-crafted", "organic", "subtle imperfections".
